    "In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data as a training set. Unlike supervised learning, there are no correct output values; the algorithm determines the patterns and similarities within the data, as opposed to relating it to some external measurement. In other words, algorithms can function freely to learn more about the data and discover interesting or unexpected findings that human beings weren't looking for.\n",

    "Limitations of supervised learning include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "·       In the case of a retrieval-based method, supervised learning systems have trouble dealing with new information. If a system with categories for cats and dogs are presented with new data -- say, a zebra -- it would have to be incorrectly lumped in one category or the other. If the AI system was generative -- that is, unsupervised -- however, it may not know what the zebra is, but it would be able to recognize it as belonging to a separate category.\n",

And I will display this in a heatmap for visualization. Each cell in the table will shows the correlation between the two variables. The value in the matrix will range from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a negative low correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates a positive high correlation. It is worth noting that I will create a numeric variable of the dataframe for the matrix to take in the numeric data only. The heatmap will be styled using seaborn tools such as colourmap.\n",

    " From this table and the heatmap visual, you can see where two variables are close to +1 with a positive correlation, it shows a good relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable is likely to increase as well, if you look at the example petal_length and petal_width (value 0.96), which means that as the petal length increases, the petal width also tends to increase. In the case where the value is close to 0, it means that there is little to no relationship between them, take a look at sepal_length and petal_width have a weak correlation coefficient (0.82), you can take away there may not be a strong relationship between these two variables. To summarize the correlation matrix is extremely useful in displaying how the different variables are related to each other, which can be useful in the next stage for understanding the data, making decisions about testing, modelling, accuracy and predictability."

    "\n",
    "I will start with the train and test function to train the model and test the dataset. This is a method to measure the accuracy of the model, which can then be used to predict the species based on the features. Firstly, I will need to split the data into train and test sets, I train the model using the training set, I test the model using the testing set. Train the model means create the model. Test the model means test the accuracy of the model. The default value for the train_test_split splits the data into 75% training data and 25% test data. To get the value of the train and test data you can use the shape method. I will create a variable to store the train, test data. Using the iloc to select the specific rows/columns from the dataframe. Once this step is complete it helps in working towards predicting the species based on the features and the accuracy of this. To do so I will classify the species using logistic regression and a confusion matrix. Logistic regression has been imported already from the sklearn library. A model of logistic regression variable is created and I will pass the earlier training datasets through this model and then predict the results with the predict method. This will contain the species names in the form of an array. To find the accuracy of the model I will use the accuracy method and this will output the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will tell you how accurately the model built will predict the species values. Using Logistic Regression, allows you to classify the iris flower samples into their respective species, from this model you can see an accuracy score of 97.37%, which shows that the model built is very accurate in predicting the species. Although it is important to note that this is a sample output, and accuracy may vary depending on the data/splits/sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case it is good to have another method to use in predicting species, here I will use a confusion matrix for this. The confusion matrix will display a matrix with actual values and predicted values based on the data from the train and test split model created earlier. This will give a breakdown of the predictions made by the model. The output of the matrix resulted in the below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. I will display this in a heatmap, where the different colours represent the intensity or magnitude of the values in the matrix, which will help in visualizing patterns and distributions of the predictions. The darker or more intense colours will represent higher values indicating accurate predictions, while lighter or less intense will represent lower values, indicating incorrect predictions. By using the confusion matrix along with logistic regression both give insights into the classification of the model built and provide accuracy on the predictions made."
